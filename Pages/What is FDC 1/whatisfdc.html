        <p class="quote">A Fire Department Connection (FDC) is a vital component of a building’s fire protection system that allows firefighters to pump water into a building’s sprinkler system or standpipe. FDCs are typically located outside the building, and are also known as Siamese connections. (FDCs are a critical link between a building’s fire protection system and fire department equipment. It allows firefighters to connec their hose to the building water supply.)

            <br><br>FDCs are required for buildings with standpipes and most buildings with fire sprinkler systems. They provide additional water to supplement a building’s existing water supplies, and can also serve as an alternative water source if the primary water supply is interrupted. 
            
            <br><br>Building owners or their designated representatives are responsible for maintaining FDCs. When connecting to an FDC, firefighters should use medium- or large-diameter hoselines, depending on whatever the FDC has a Storz connection.</p>
            <br><br>
        <p class="quote">Fire sprinklers and FDCs are both important components of a building’s fire safety and protection system, but they have different functions and locations:

            <br><br>Fire sprinklers - These automatic extinguishing systems are heat-activated and release wather through sprinkler heads to prevent fire spread. Sprinkler heads are usually located high up on the ceiling and must be unobstructed.
            
            <br><br>FDCs - These connection points on the exterior of a building allow firefighters to connect to the building’s water supply. FDCs are required for all fire sprinkler and standpipe systems and have three main types (exposed, freestanding, and flush). They can be used to supplement the water supply for a sprinkler or standpipe system, or in some cases, to provide all of the water. FDCs are tested separately from sprinkler systems, which are tested every five years. Also, FDCs are usually located on the exterior of a building often near the main entrance.</p>
